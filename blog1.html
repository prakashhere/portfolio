      <h5>Artificial Intelligence, more commonly known as AI has been in the news
        for decades. However, only in the recent past, has it been integrated with
        all our electronic devices. It has the capability to
        think and behave like humans. It has the potential to take over many
        tasks performed by humans, that produces cost, time and effort savings. In this
        article, I are going to highlight some points related to the
        benefits and disadvantages of artificial intelligence...<br><br> June 22, 2023</h5>

        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
      <div class="img" style="height:200px;">

      </div>
      <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a
        technology that allows a computer program
      to learn, reason, and act on its own. It's a machine-to-machine emulation of human
      intellect that makes them do things that humans normally do. In simplest terms,
      AI refers to a device's ability to function similarly to human intelligence and
      perform tasks that humans would perform.</p>
      <p>AI improves the way we think and the way we explore new horizons. AI boosts
        our ability to imagine and explore new possibilities. Below we have discussed
        the pros and cons of artificial intelligence:</p><br>

        <h2>Pros of AI</h2>
        <p>AI is highly accurate and its use reduces human error.<br><br>
            AI allows automating repetitive tasks in different industries.<br><br>
            AI can easily handle and process Big Data.<br><br>
            AI can fetch insights faster from processed data which allows faster Decision-Making.
            AI also has continuous availability and does not require breaks like humans.<br><br>
            AI-powered Digital Assistants can easily interact with customers and reduce workloads
            of customer service staff by resolving customer queries through chats.<br><br>
            AI helps to mitigates risks as AI systems can be deployed in environment which are
            hazardous to humans.<br><br>
            AI can uncover trends and patterns from a given dataset faster than humans which
            makes AI suitable for decision-making.<br><br>
            AI systems can assist organizations in designing and improving processes as
            well as workflows.
        </p><br>

        <h2> Cons of AI</h2>
        <p>AI increases human dependency on machines which can lead to laziness.<br><br>
            AI implementation requires businesses to invest in advanced infrastructure and
            training the employees which makes AI expensive.<br><br>
            AI implementation can likely cause an increase in unemployment as AI systems can
            perform work of multiple human workers at once.<br><br>
            AI uses a set of algorithms for predictions which makes AI systems practical.
            These are less creative and innovative in challenging situations.<br><br>
            AI cannot understand emotions which is a key aspect in sales and marketing.<br><br>
            It is difficult to implement ethics in AI systems.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence has massive potential to create a better place to live in.
            The most important thing is to ensure that AI isn't used excessively. Although
            there are advantages and disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence, its impact
            on the global industry is undeniable.
